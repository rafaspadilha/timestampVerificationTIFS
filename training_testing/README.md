# Training and Evaluation
This folder contains example files for the training and evaluation of the model. Both examples consider the DenseNet backbone for the visual encoders, with all input modalities (ground-level image, timestamp, location coordinates, and satellite image), optimized for multi-task (consistency verification and transient attribute estimation).

- `train.py`: example training script;
- `test.py`: example testing script;
- `models`: directory that stores a dummy model/weight file;
